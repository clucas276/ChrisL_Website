    <h1>Unit2</h1>
    <div>
    <h3>Content and layout for each page(1.1):
    </h3>
    </div>
    <p>For the first page I will have a welcome page which will include a brief intro about me, hobbies and what I am doing at the moment. This will all be at the top centra of the screen so it is easily accessible and easy to read. I will most likely have links to other pages at the top or sides of the page, I will add them both and then decide which i prefer before deciding this for definite.
    </p>
    <p>The second page will include programming languages I have learnt or I am learning and show previous projects such as the team game I helped to make. I will also mention how I am still working on the game as it really interests me and I would love to break into this sector. Again this will most likely be in the top middle of the screen for ease of use and to look professional.
    </p>
    <p>The third page will include details about where I want to go with programming in the future and a contact me page. Again this will stick to the same layout as the other page so everything matches and is all uniform.
    </p>
    <h3>Copyright and other constraints(1.5):
    </h3>
    <p>I don't think I will have much issue with copyright as I will be coding the website myself and placing all my own content into the site. If I want to add any images I will use images that people place on open source sites that are available for anyone to use freely. I will make everything open as free software usually declares you do.
    </p>
    <p>"the original creation has an automatic right, the copyright, by the mere fact of its existence (if the work is original, the authorâ€™s copyright is born on the creation, with no formality)"[12]
    </p>
    <p>Using various free software to make my website, such as notepad or Atom. I will still be able use my website for profit from what I have researched: 
    </p>
    <p>"Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?
        Absolutely. All Open Source software can be used for commercial purposes; the Open Source Definition guarantees this. You can even sell Open Source software."[13]
        </p>
    <p>An issue companies building websites could run into are the fact that the copyright for logos, artwork and even the website itself belong to the company that created it and not the business that paid for the service. This can be worked around however by specifying who owns the copyright. likewise if a company hires employees to make the designs, the company then owns the copyright and not the person who actually made it.[14]
    </p>
    <h3>Access issues(1.6):
    </h3>
    <p>The issues that may arise with my website is that anyone with dyslexia may not be able to read my website properly, or anyone with a visual impairment who struggles to read small writing on a bright white page. To overcome this I maybe able to add an option that adds a different background colour to make it more accessible and easy to read should they need it. I could also maybe include a text to speech function if I can figure out how to implement one.
    </p>
    <p>From what I have researched I will not have to place any of these things into the website as I am not a public sector and will be making the website for private purposes so will exempt from accessibility laws such as the Equality Act 2010 and WCAG 2.1 [15]
    </p>
    <h3>Filetypes(1.7):
    </h3>
    <p>The file types I will be using are .CSS which is the cascading Stylesheet file and .HTML for the HyperText Markup Language file. I don't think I will need anything else but when I learn the language this may change. I will also be using Rich Text Format for anything I need to quickly type up for reference in notepad. If I want to add any animations to my website I will save them with the .PNG(Portable Network Graphics) but for normal images I will be using .JPG which is the shorter expression of .JPEG(joint photographic experts group) [16]
