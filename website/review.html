    <h1>Review unit 1 outcome 2:
    </h1>
    <h3>1.2.1:  Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
        your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello:
        </h3>
    <p>The tools I mainly used for the making of my website were VS code and google. Both of these were a massive help as if ever iI wasn't sure how something worked I could quickly google a solution and 9 times out of 10 someone had the same issues I have in the past and there was multiple forums I could look through to find solutions to my problems. I never actually had to make my own posts because of this reason so this made a massive difference in my project.
    </p>
    <p>VS code was also a massive help as it had tools such as autofil and also templates which came in extremely handy. Using autofil and templates I was able to easily make multiple pages for my site and get them working together seemlessly. I was a big fan of pycharm when we was learning python and I kind of felt at home coming from pycharm to VS code as they both have the dark mode, multiple window options so you can keep tabs on different webpages you are making and also switch between HTML and CSS on the fly. And the autofill helps with proper elements and such.
    </p>
    <p>Another tool I tried to use but didn't use that much was trello. Trello is great for teams working on projects as it allows everyone to be more in sync with each other, see exactly what each team member is working on, see what needs to be done and what has already been completed. It helps with being able to set dates and times things need to be completed by and even adding checklists as to tick off mini tasks inside the main task you are working on.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2:
        Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello:
        </h3>
    <p>The tools I selected were very appropiate as VS code is perfect for writing HTML and CSS, as mentioned earlier I was a big fan of pycharm and coming over to VS code after that I felt quite at home, they had a similar layout and it was very easy to just pick up VS code after using pycharm. The multiple tabs are super handy to quickly switch between different HTML pages to add or make changed to them and also being able to quickly change to CSS for the same reason helps alot. I have not used other tools but I have seen things like IDLE being used and them seem very clunky and not helpful at all. This is not the case with pycharm and VS code.
    </p>
    <p>Again google was extremely appropiate as it seems like at some point or another different people have ran into the same problems I faced so it was always super easy to find solutions to my problems fairly easy. I never had to look very far to find an answer to an issue i was having.
    </p>
    <p>Trello was also appropiate as it can help with setting stages out so you have a clear roadmap of what needs to be done and what still needs doing. It can help keep to a strict timeline so your project does not run over.
    </p>
    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
        your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
        interests of openness. What would you change? 
        </h3>
    <p>I feel the strengths of my website is that it contains alot of relevant information for the prject and everything works how I wanted it to and how it should. It looks like someone has put a little bit of time into it and not just thrown it together in 2 minutes and I am happy with the outcome. The weaknesses of my project is that it does not look fantastic, I feel it looks acceptable but not amazing. I could of spent longer making everything look perfect but after doing this project I have come to the conclusion that I would rather focus on back end development and would not like to progress my front end development any further
    </p>
    <p> Overall I am happy with the way my website looks. I could go back and make changes to make it look more professional, I still may go back and change the layout of the text so everything goes from left to right instead of central now I know how the margins work. I maybe would of added the background box so it fits over all the text in one go rather than a seperate box for each paragraph. As I stated earlier though I am interested alot more in learning the back end development side of things rather than the front end side so I am happy with what it looks like with what I have learnt. One thing I am very happy with is the background image and how the text scrolls over it rather 
    </p>
    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project :
    </h3>
    <p>Further improvements I could make would be making everything abit neater, like having the background boxes all line up and having the text fit inside the boxes goig from left to right instead of everything central and backgrounds all split up. I would use margins to set the text exactly where I wanted it similar to how I have done already. I wanted to make my links to page one and two neater aswell, maye closer together all in the same bar at the top like a navbar.
    </p>
    <p>I could also add more images to personlise the site more but I am honestly happy with just the background image which is taken from something close to me so I will not add anymore.
    </p>
    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose:
    </h3>
    <p>My Website has followed my plan fairly cloesly, I wanted to have the about me at the tog of the page and the navbar at the top aswell. I also wanted to have multiple pages for the different sections of the website which again is something I accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>The things that did change however were when I originally read the brief it looked like we was making a website that was a portfolio for future job aspects so we could show them thing such as about me, things I am currently working on and have worked on in the past and lastly where I wanted to go with programming in the future.
    </p>
    <p>"You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however,
        you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and
        areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including
        pages/sections and a how you built it page: "
        </p>
    <p> however we were told that we was actually making the website that we would insert this essay we have been working on to be able to show the examiner so I have had to make changes to layouts of what I originlly wanted to accomodate this. Changes I have implemented are things like only having two web pages, the first page being unit 1 and the second page being unit 2. I could of had these on one page but I think it looks better having them on two seperate pages and it also allowed me to research and show I could make a proper website with multiple pages and have it working correctly.
    </p>
    <p>I was planning on using Trello alot to help with my website as when we did the group project trello came in very handy to see what needed to be done, what our teammates were working on and it all updated in real time so we would also be working on something that needed to be done and didn't have the problem of two people working on the same task. However I found for single projects that we don't have alot of time to complete Trello was not helping me that much so I started off using it for planning my essay but eventually found myself just getting on with the essay and making my website as I already had a clear plan in my head and trello was just an unnessercery step that would of slowed down the project instead of speeding up and helping it. I would definetely use trello again if I was in a group project as it is great for that however for single projects, unless it was a huge project with many different steps, I would most likely not use trello again as it does not help me.
    </p>
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
        productivity and efciency – could you have been more efcient when making your
        website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
        </h3>
    <p>As I have spoke about earlier some of the benefits of tools such as VS code is the auto fill feature so if you are just getting into using HTML or CSS the autofill helps with making sure you don't miss any closing elements out, i feel they could make it even better in this regard and have it similar to pycharm where if you make a mistake it would point out where you have gone wrong and let you know exactly what needs to be done to change it. The different tabs you can have open aswell makes it really easy to be able to just switch between different projects you are working on make a change and go back to your other page and carry on with what you was working on.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing I have touched on is Trello. I found trello to be extremely good for team projects as it really helps with efficiency, being able to see exactly what your team is workong and an what needs to be done, what has already been done and having time frames of when things should be done is great. But the best thing was being able to see what teammates are working on in real time (as long as they update it) as this prevents the same people working on the same project and wasting time. I didnt find it to helpful on a project made by a single person however as I already had a good idea of what needed to be done and what had already been completed, especialy seeing as we had such a small time frame to complete the project it really was not needed and i felt like I was better off just not using it and cracking on with what needed to be done. 
    </p>
    <p>I feel that working in teams would of helped as we could of all been working on a sepearate page and we could get more work done each day however the website would also be nowhere near as personal and I couldn't just make a change to the site with what i feels look best, I would have to run it by my team and see what they thought of it first. An example of this would be the backgroun image i added, my teammates would of not wanted something like that as they would of had no idea what it was from and instead wanted things they like. 
    </p>
    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency:
    </h3>
    <p>I feel like I was pretty productive on this project but ways I could of been more productive would of been stuff like when I googled a question I had of how to implement something, rather than looking at the whole forum for not only the thing I was struglling with but to also learn tips and tricks of things not related to my problem, I could of just found my answer, implemented it and moved on however I would not have learnt as much.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing is I came into HTML not knowing anything so I really went out of my way to learn everything I needed to be able to get the site to my standards, if I had previous knowledge I would of been alot more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>Finally I probably would of been more efficient if I enjoyed what I was doing. I have learnt from this project that my heart definetely belongs to the back end side of things. For instance I loved our first project of making a text based game in python and constantly found my self wanting to add more and pushing myself to learn more however with the website I would still look things up but I wasn't as passionate and excited and I feel this definitely slowed me down while creating the site. It was still fun learning how to program the site such as learning how to add the templates, adding the elements such as < p > and < a href=""> description < /a >(I had to add spaces for the elements as it was making new paragraphs), but trying to find a good colour scheme, matching all the text up and the background boxes to make every match and look neat is definitely not for me.
    </p>
    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
        would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? :
        </h3>
    <p>To improve my own productivity next time I would maybe try team work to bounce some of the design idea's off each other and hope someone in my team loved the design side of things. I would also be able to implement trello alot more using this method and also slack to be able to talk to teammates instantly for the idea's. I could also try to style my site differently to see if I could get it more professional looking and less like a personal site although I do like the personal touch more than the professional touch.
    </p>
    <p>I would also try different text editors to see if there are any that match pycharm more closely such as the features telling you if you are missing colons or anything as I feel this helps to streamline the process and make everything run alot more smoothly.
    </p>
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions:
    </h3>
    <p>I honestly feel that the best method of testing is just trial and error. There were times when I was making the site where I would just enter a value, see how it looked and just keep trying until I had things exactly how I liked them. I have found this method to be very effective in the past for me trying to come up with a solution to a problem and after every trial I usually learn from it and it gives me a better idea of where to go next. It may not be the fastest method of testing but I feel it is the most throughough as you can test alot of values and find a perfect solution.
