        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>My name is Christopher Lucas but I go by Chris to most people or Clucas to my close friends. I am 26 years old and currently live in Royton. I share my flat with a little tiger called Patrick.
            </p>
        <p>I love gaming and will be playing a variety of games whenever i get some downtime, my favourite games include the metal gear solid and the gears of war series. My love of games is what led me to take up a games development course at college and I received an HND from Hopwood hall college with distinction, however the course was mainly the art side of things such as concept art and making models to go into games. While I did enjoy making character models and environments for the games i was a terrible drawer and concept art was something i hated.
            </p>
            <p>This is what led me to try and get into the programming side of things and how I found out about Codenation. I had done a tiny bit of python before starting the course however it was really not much so i have learnt a lot from the course and have enjoyed my time thoroughly so far. For the first project we were split into small teams and was tasked with making a text based game which I loved. I honestly wish we had more time to make the game as it was great fun making it and I will definitely be going back to it in my free time to flesh it out more.

    <h3>Purpose of IT in modern business(1.1):</h3>

    <p>"Starting in the early 1980s with the first desktop computers, information technology has played an important part in the U.S. and global economies. Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace." [1]
        </p>
    <p>From product development to globalisation IT has played a huge part in how businesses operate in today's modern world. 
        </p>
    <p>IT can help speed up the time it takes for new products to reach the market. A company could produce a product requirement or specification by looking up information from databases, sales representatives and even the customers the product is intended for. CAD (Computer assisted design)  helps to speed up the decision making process and also the manufacturing process itself. Fom advancements in microprocessors to efficient drug delivery systems, IT can help a business respond rapidly to ever changing customer needs. [2]
        </p>
    <p>Another way IT helps businesses is with security. A Lot of businesses are constantly under threat, whether it is someone trying to steal company ideas or attacks that can bring a website offline, resulting in the potential loss of money, Technology can be used to protect the business. From financial data to confidential data, IT can help to keep ideas and data from the competition. With passwords and encryption a business can make sure none of its projects can be stolen by the competition or have financial information stolen. [3]
        </p>
    <p>Looking at all this you can see why IT is important for businesses, not only does it help the business to compete in an ever growing, 24/7 global marketplace, it also helps companies come up with new ideas quicker and then also to make those ideas a reality faster than would normally be possible. Customers can contact the company quicker resulting in happy customers who expect all problems to be resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible and also keep those ideas safe from competition. It helps make sure their finances 
        are all in the correct order and safe from attacks while constantly updating employee records making sure employees are working efficiently and also being paid the correct wage automatically each month. This all helps to make everything a business does simpler and more efficient.
        </p>
    <h3>Methods skills and resources(1.2):
    </h3>
    <div>
    <p>First of all we should look into what is a digital project? 
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>Digital projects are typically products which are developed and then delivered digitally. It can be pretty much anything from software application to a website. These will all have one thing in common however. They are all virtual products that are delivered as a service to a client. [4]
        </p>
    <p>To make a successful project I will need a lot of planning, time management and to also learn the skills needed to make the site. For this I will be learning HTML and CSS and most likely entering the HTML code into notepad and then viewing the HTML page in my browser. [5]
        </p>
    <p>The digital project I will be making will be a website. To make this website I will be using tools such as Trello in order to keep everything I need to do and have completed  organised well and I can easily go to the site and see exactly what still needs to be done. and draw.io. This will help me to draw out exactly how I want my website to work in a step by step guide which again I can come back at anytime to see exactly what needs doing to my website and how I can go about doing it.
        </p>
    <p>Time management will be a crucial skill needed as the time frame for the project is quite small so I can't make the website to complex or I will not have enough time to implement everything I want to add. I will need to use good time management for not only researching into HTML and CSS but also planning and creating the website itself.
        </p>
    <p>The resources I will need for the project will be any credited website I can find to help me learn HTML and CSS so w3schools.com and codeacademy for example as well as any others I come across. After a very quick search I have come across HTML.com which looks promising.
        </p>
    <h3>Planning and carrying out tasks(1.3):
    </h3>
    <p>I have kind of covered this in the previous task however as stated earlier I will use Trello to map out exactly what needs to be done, what is being done and what has been completed. I have already made a start on this making a tab with each of the questions for this essay and giving a quick description of how i am going to go about doing them. I have given myself time restrictions so keep with the time management side of things that I have touched upon as I feel time management will be crucial for this project as I have things I need to learn before even starting with my website. I will include exactly what needs to be researched, how much to research into that area and how I went about doing it.
        </p>
    <p>I will also be using draw.io to map out how the website will function. I will start with the homepage giving a quick introduction to the website with the option to go to any page from that main page. This will either be at the top of the page or at the side, whichever I think looks best when i come to do the website. Other pages will include the about me section, things like my name, age and what got me into programming. The other pages will include projects I have completed on the course and also what I am currently working on as well as what I want to carry on working on in future. I have not used draw.io that much so I will have to familiarise myself with it to truly make the most of it.
        </p>
    <h3>Risks (1.4):</h3>
    <div>
    <p>To my knowledge, the things that could cause a digital project to fail are poor planning and time management.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>These could both fall into the same category but I will talk about them independently. Poor planning will make it harder to follow a good time management plan as you will not be able to follow a guide and will end up just wasting time trying to think of where to go next instead of being able to look at your plan ,see what has been done and what is still to be done. It will also look a bit more sloppy if there is no general plan and you are just winging it.
    </p>
    <p>Time management is a huge factor, especially as we don't have that long to complete the project. I will need to plan the project, design how I want everything. learn how exactly to use HTML to be able to code it and then actually make the website followed by testing to make sure everything runs smoothly. If bad use of time management is implemented then one area will be lacking such as testing as the deadline draws nearer, I will have less time to be able to test the final product and as I learnt from the last project, testing can be critical especially in programming.
    </p>
    <p>After researching I have come across an interesting concept which is "Fixed plans that don't account for change". If I want a feature that simply isn't feasible to implement i would have to be able to go back and change the plan around to make something simpler and completely change it to get it running. Failure to do this could make the project look shoddy as if it wasn't planned out that well even if I had a great plan in mind going in. [6]
    </p>
    <p>Another crucial step is over ambition. Wanting perfection instead of accepting what is actually feasible with my skill set is a sure way to make sure the project fails. Make something simple that works and then I can add to it to make it better rather than starting with something extremely complex that takes forever, doesn't even work properly and has been a huge waste of time that could have been doing something that works and can be implemented. [7]
    </p>
    <p>Finally, remote working teams could help a project to fail due to lack of communication. The use of software such as slack could help this problem as it would enable instant communication between the team and you can upload files you have been working on to share them with the team. Trello is another great tool to use as you can assign each member a role they need to be doing and can see exacly what they are doing and what they have completed it real time.
    </p>
    <h3>Using IT systems and software(1.5):
    </h3>
    <p>The software I will be using will be notepad to create and edit my code to be implemented into the webpages. After a quick search I have seen some third party editors such as notepad++ and visual studio code that I may look into for that extra bit of help. [8]
    </p>
    <p>I will be using HTML which is the language which most websites are written. It stands for HyperText Markup Language is used to create pages and make them functional. Hypertext means that the document will contain links that allow the user to jump to different places in the document or to a completely different document altogether. The most current version is HTML5 [9] I will also be using CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is how HTML elements are to be displayed and can save a lot of work as it can control the layouts of multiple web pages at once. These are stored as CSS files.[10]
    </p>
    <p>I will also be making use of trello to be able to plan out exactly what needs to be done, what I am currently doing and what I have completed. This will enable me to have a clear direction of what I have done and where I need to be heading in order to get the website up and running. I could also use slack to communicate with the people on the same course as me to share ideas or to get some feedback.
    </p>
    <h3>Analysis(1.6):
    </h3>
    <p>Trello has been a great help for me in the past with our team based project of making a text based game. We as a team could all add what we were working on and as it updates in real time that was extremely helpful as we could all see exactly what needed to be done, who was doing what right then and what has been completed or what needs to be reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>It has also helped tremendously with the website as I for a start I could easily plan out and see what needed to be completed for this essay. It also helped with the planning of my website as I could get a basic idea of what I wanted to do next with the site and in what time frame things needed to be completed. I could see completed items as well so i knew what had been finished and I could forget about. I also had a review tab for things i needed more time with but had been pretty much finished so I can come back to them if I get the time.
    </p>
    <p>Draw.io was also a massive help as I could plan exactly how I wanted the website to look, which link would take you where and link everything together nicely. By following what I had pre planned it made things much simpler as I just had to code the website using the structure I already knew I needed rather than thinking about it on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>Another great programme I used was Visual Studio Code as this enabled me to code HTML quickly and efficently. It was a great help when I was first learning HTML with the auto fill features as not only did this save time but the Autofill showed me how I needed the text to look in order to get it working which in turn helped it sink in a little easier as I could see exactly what needed to happen with each bit of code.
    </p>
    <p>I have also used GITHUB for the group project work which was a massive help as we could update our code and upload it and if we had both worked on the same thing then we could implement both changes without losing any of the  work both of us did. Using this combined with trello to make sure we always knew what each other was working on so we didn't end up doing the same things made the project go really smoothly.
    </p>
    <h3>GDPR(1.7):
    </h3>
    <p>The general Data Protection Regulations came into effect on the 25th of may 2018 and apply to all organisations, including both charities and voluntary organisations that process anyone's personal data. If an organisation holds personal data, which is anything from contact information, ethnicity, religious belief to bank or credit card information it applies to them. There are the right to be informed, right of access, right to rectification, right to be forgotten, right to restrict processing, right to data portability, right to object and rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.
    </p>
    <p>It allows more transparency with how companies collect and use data and informs the people if there is a breach that would result in a risk to the rights and freedom to an individual. People have the right to assess how the data is being used, the right to be forgotten, which means the company has to halt processing the data.
    </p>
    <p>If a company is found to be in breach of the GDPR they can be fined up to 4% of their annual global turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is greater, which are the maximum fines for the most severe infringements. Both controllers and processors are included so cloud based companies are not exempt. [11]
